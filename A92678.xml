            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to your requeſt in your laſt, I ſhall comunicate unto you ſuch intelligence as is with us: An expreſs came hither the laſt night from the Committee of Eſtates at EDENBURGH, the contents whereof is rumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſome farther inſtructions to the SCOTS Commiſſioners reciding here which inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by directions forthwith were to be urged by them in the Treaty, if it were not broken of before theſe Letters came to their hands, and if nothing effectuall could be agreed on whthin a time lymitted in the ſaid Inſtructions, then the report goes that the Commiſſioners are remanded home; what will be the iſſue of theſe things tyme (the diſcoverer of truth) will produce, but of this you may be fully aſſured that as in all other Treaties ſo eſpecially in this hath appeared great intricaſie, and although par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular concluſions have been kept in obſcurity,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165633:3"/>that yet many generalls tendered, are openly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, which as I have gathered conſiſt of theſe heads following viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That ſome Lords about the Declared King of SCOTS would take advantage by this Treaty to gaine a power by the ſword, and while the Presbytery are ſeeking for an agreement, the Cavalliere party would get into the field who want not malice but for the preſent want rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and ſtrength, and whilſt the Scots are Treating for an Accommodation, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy ſhould deſtroy them by a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering war.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This appeares in the not recalling of MON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TROSSES Commiſsion, but to the contrary let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are ſent to the ſaid Montroſſe, to proſecute his Commiſsion, notwithſtanding the Treaty on foote, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It hath been alleaged by the Scots Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners, that they find their King backward to ſatisfie and grant the deſires of that Nation, by which, at the firſt, ſay they, we have little aſſurance that this treaty will take effect; but that after much time ſpent, nothing will be yielded to which will anſwer their juſt deſires.</p>
            <p n="4">4 They have conſidered what their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is like to be, when the Treaty is over; for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165633:3"/>ſhould the other party get head during the Treaty, and then the ſame ſhould be broken off, all men would ſay, that the Covenanters of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, were out witted, and if that by an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt them and their King, new troubles ſhould ariſe amongſt themſelves, the world would judge them more miſerable then they are already, and ſo by hopes of bettering their condition, ſhould make it much worſe then it was before.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Theſe and ſuch like doubts have been put on in behalf of the Scots, in regard many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which have chiefly their Kings eare, are known not to promote or forward any Treaty or other buſineſs of importance in behalf of their King, but on purpoſe and with intent to deceive, for which cauſe a Miniſter of theirs told their King, that unleſs he would remove from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him ſome of thoſe Lords that were with him, they could expect little good from him.</p>
            <p>Having thus far with as much plainneſs and certainty as I can given you what I hear concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the one ſide, I ſhall not leave you altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unſatisfied, as touching the other: Their King, ſaith our Intelligence, condeſcends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they ſhall have the ordering and diſpoſe of the Militia of that Kingdom
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165633:4"/>five yeares, and after the expiration of the ſaid Terme, he would have it come into his own hands, and that an Act ſhall paſſe accordingly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That an Act ſhall paſſe, that all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhall take the Covenant, but would be free from that Engagement himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He condeſcendes, that when he finds a convenient time, he will come into Scotland in perſon, upon ſecurity, that he ſhall not be ſold, delivered up, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The frame of affaires ſtanding on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: ſuch as drive forward the Royal intereſt, look very ſad, and expreſs no little diſcontent, and would rather plunge their young King into the like extremity with themſelves, then by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf upon anothers, they ſhould be left without hopes of remedy of being reſtored in condition or honour, which being likewiſe the way, the young Gentleman is chiefly inclined, fills his braines with dubious thoughts, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times apprehending it to be his beſt courſe to ſit ſtill, and let others act what they can for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and another which carries it faire with the Commiſsioners of Scotland, with whom the Prince of Orange adviſeth him to agree, and tells him, that were the caſe his own, he would go into Scotland, and (for fear of being a burden
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165633:4"/>to him) ſaith, that if he had a hundred lives, he would adventure them all upon that way, which together with other Arguments, hath moved him to ſend the Lord Lauderdale to the Prince of ORANGE with a Meſſage, ſignifying that he intends ſhortly to be with him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him ſurther in all things concerning the Treaty. In the mean time a Declaration is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, with as much plauſibleneſs as may be, ſhewing how far the KING hath condeſcended to their deſires, yet wil it be a difficult taske to give ſatisfaction, for many of the Scots ſtick not to ſay that ſome things like a fly in a Box of Oyntment, will be an abhorring in the noſtrils of moſt of the Presbyterian Clergy, who cannot but be jealous what good is like to be effected by this meanes, and may juſtly doubt, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilded pretences of ſuch as are known enemies: there ever lies ſomething both poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous and formidable; however it is ſpoken with great confidence, and by ſuch as are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed privy to the ſecret negotiations, that there is an agreement, the manner is like to be known in Scotland as ſoone as here, for that diſpatches are haſtened thither, and by ſuch time as they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive there, their Parliament, ſay ſome of that party, will be ſitting: the Commiſsioners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165633:5"/>it is thought will go ſhortly after: Their declared King is going into <hi>Sweden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for</hi> England, <hi>whilſt they remain united, its dreadful to its enemies, who have little hopes to effect any malitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne againſt it, ſo long as the ſweet harmony of peace and concord, remaineth there: therefore it is the duty of every one that eſteeme their own good, and the peace and welfare of the Nation, to endeavour the continuance of this happy knot, ſeeing that nothing but the looſening thereof can hinder us from tranquillity at home, or give advantage to our Enemies abroad. Much more might be ſpoken of this nature; but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to exceed the bounds of a Letter, and ſhall conclude with this word of advice to my Countreymen, That they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves wiſely in their ſeverall ſtations, the onely way to enjoy and continue that bleſſing of peace, which is the harty prayer of,</hi> Sir,</p>
